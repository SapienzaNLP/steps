<!-- ## Code Release  -->

<!-- * The code for running the experiments of STEPS will be released soon! -->

## Environment Setup

Requirements:

* Debian-based (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, ...) system
* [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)

We strongly advise utilizing the bash script setup.sh to set up the python environment for this project.
Run the following command to quickly setup the env needed to run our code: 

```
bash ./setup.sh
```
It's a bash command that will setup a conda environment with everything you need. Just answer the prompts as you proceed.

## Checkpoint

* Checkpoint of STEPS will be released soon!

## Train

Training is done via the training script, src/train.py, and its parameters are read from the .yaml files in the conf/ folders. Once you applied all your desired changes, you can run the new training with:

```
(steps) user@user-pc:~/steps$ PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python src/train.py
```

## Evaluate

If you want to evaluate the model you just have to run the following command:

```
(steps) user@user-pc:~/steps$ PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python src/predict.py --ckpt <steps_checkpoint.ckpt>
```
